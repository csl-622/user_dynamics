The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Lola JimJim was the star. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey  Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 [[slave|women]], all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement: "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory". She concludes: "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]".{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance".{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, and the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement: "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory". She concludes: "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004. 

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a women's squad.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]]. [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow.

Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and nearly went behind after 15 minutes.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gill Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004. 

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a women's squad.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]]. [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and nearly went behind after 15 minutes.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gill Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

"Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004. 

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]]. [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and nearly went behind after 15 minutes.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gill Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

"Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004. 

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]]. [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and nearly went behind after 15 minutes.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gill Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004. 

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]]. [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and nearly went behind after 15 minutes.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004. 

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]]. [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004. 

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only a handful of competitors in the hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities attempted to fill the resulting gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July; two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], then the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556180 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|300px|The Zimbabweans celebrate after their 4–0 win over Poland at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]], Moscow]]
The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and also the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

"Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxhall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement: "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory". She concludes: "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxhall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement: "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory". She concludes: "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxhall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxhall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement: "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory". She concludes: "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper.

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement: "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory". She concludes: "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement: "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory". She concludes: "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]].

"Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's field hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent undefeated victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was widely regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first of any colour at the Olympics.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's field hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had just become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, just 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to organise and send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manageress. Every player and official was [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself; [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player; the youngest was [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions entirely unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points would be awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves massive [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

Zimbabwe were one of the teams in the first ever women's Olympic hockey match, playing against Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal in women's Olympic hockey to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2, with McKillop and Chase scoring. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st; Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white and blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both of Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at right-half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and according to Byrom "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes on the clock, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's field hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals, the joint-fifth most in the event. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxhall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities;{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]];{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]; it has been called a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes—"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams had been eliminated in qualifying and were competing as a result of the boycott.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the U.S.-led boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "Nobody who shared the joy of the players and officials could deny them their moment of glory," she concludes. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world, but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the Zimbabwean press, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==

The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Elizabeth Chase|Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible," Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==

The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's [[Brigitte Kindler]] equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 minutes of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other."{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world," she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[Upset (competition)|upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[Upset (competition)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[Upset (competition)|upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[Upset (competition)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in the [[Soviet Union]] capital, [[Moscow]]. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset (sports)|upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medalists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{#tag:ref|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

[[File:RIAN archive 556176 Women's field hockey team from Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Members of the Zimbabwean team celebrate after their victory over Poland.|alt=Two women joyfully embrace]]
Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

The 1980 [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]] won the gold medal in women's [[field hockey]] at that year's [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], the capital of the [[Soviet Union]]. The squad of 16 women, all from [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|Olympic boycott]] created in the [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|women's hockey competition]]. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the [[round-robin tournament]] with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge [[upset]], particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as [[Rhodesia]] in [[Rhodesia at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on [[artificial turf]], which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]] and drawing with [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]]. Dubbed the "Golden Girls" by the [[media of Zimbabwe]], they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.

==Invitation and team selection==
The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the capital of the [[Soviet Union]], were the first to include a [[field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|competition]] in women's [[field hockey]].{{refn|Men's field hockey first appeared at the Olympics in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and has been played continuously since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].{{sfn|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=156}}|group="n"|name="mens"}} Pre-tournament favourites included [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]], the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany women's national field hockey team|West Germany]], but the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led Western boycott]] of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Moscow marked the southern African nation's [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|return to the Olympics]] after 16 years; as [[Rhodesia]] it had been excluded from the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] Games for political reasons following the mostly [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] government's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] from Britain in 1965.{{sfn|Little|2005}} The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|women's squad]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

A squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} [[Ann Grant]], the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. [[Anthea Stewart]], who had played for [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]] 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. [[Liz Chase]], the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while [[Arlene Boxall]], the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in [[Sandra Chick|Sandy Chick]] and [[Sonia Robertson]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Entirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer [[Duncan Fletcher]].{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}} The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and then to [[Luanda]] in Angola,{{sfn|Caute|1983|p=438}} from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the [[artificial turf|artificial hockey surface]]."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}

==Tournament==
The event was organised as a [[round-robin tournament]] in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were [[Austria women's national field hockey team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia women's national field hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[India women's national field hockey team|India]], [[Poland women's national field hockey team|Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union women's national field hockey team|USSR]]; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} All of the matches were played at [[Dynamo Minor Arena (Moscow)|Dynamo Minor Arena]] in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2008 a}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2008 b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves serious [[underdog (term)|underdogs]] and did not expect to win a medal.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}}

Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} [[Patricia McKillop|Pat McKillop]] scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before [[Patricia Davies|Pat Davies]], [[Linda Watson]] and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.{{sfn|Zimbabwe Olympic Committee}}

Stewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit "lucky" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Herald]]'' newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a [[Field hockey#Penalty stroke|penalty stroke]], flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper [[Sarah English]] into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, [[Brenda Phillips]] replaced [[Christine Prinsloo]] at [[field hockey#Formations|right-half]].{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Urged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, "ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege" throughout the second half.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}  With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|short corner]] that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. [[Gillian Cowley]] made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's [[Field hockey#Free hits|free hit]] was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [[:wiktionary:through ball|through pass]] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other".{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

A few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

Zimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from [[Bulawayo]], made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's [[Natella Krasnikova]]. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}}

==Reactions and legacy==
[[File:Sally Hayfron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sally Hayfron|Sally Mugabe]] promised each of the players an ox, but ultimately gave them packages of meat instead.|alt=A woman in a yellow and green African-style dress smiles]]

The victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the "Golden Girls" by Zimbabwean reporters.{{sfn|Byrom|McDermott|Streak|1980|pp=249–253}} They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities.{{sfn|Harris|2008 b}} Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife [[Sally Hayfron|Sally]], but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa.{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirumanzu|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Daily News|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country did not win another Olympic medal until [[Kirsty Coventry]] won three swimming medals in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].{{sfn|Sandu|Muchinjo|2004}} Robert Mugabe promptly applied the "golden girl" nickname to her on her return home.{{sfn|Mathers|2010}}

The Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great [[upset]]. Sports historians have called it a "fairytale"{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}} and an "irresistible fairy story".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2010|p=239}} While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, "ruined" the 1980 Olympics.{{sfn|Sullivan|1984}} While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. "They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance."{{sfn|Harris|2008 a}}
